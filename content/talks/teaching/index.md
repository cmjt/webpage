# RShiny Applications
 
 - [vested](https://statbiscuit.shinyapps.io/vested/): virtual experiments to teach experimental design.
 - [**s**tatbiscuit **wor**ksheet**s**](https://statbiscuit.github.io/swots/) (swots) that go hand in hand with courses I teach ([source code here](https://github.com/statbiscuit/statbiscuits/tree/master/swots)).
 - [probable](https://cmjt.shinyapps.io/probable): an RShiny application that allows students to explore the shapes of probability distributions([source code](https://github.com/cmjt/statbiscuits/tree/master/probable)).
 - [RShiny application introducing linear additive model with the Palmer penguins dataset]( https://cmjt.shinyapps.io/penguin/). Link to the [source code](https://github.com/statbiscuit/statbiscuits/tree/master/dashboards/penguin) and link to more info about [the data](https://github.com/allisonhorst/palmerpenguins).
 - [Using aRt as an introduction to linear modelling](https://cmjt.shinyapps.io/genart/) inspired by [Danielle Navarro's](https://djnavarro.net/) blog [Notes from a data witch: Art, jasmines, and the water colours](https://blog.djnavarro.net/water-colours).
