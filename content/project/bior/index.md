The aim of this project is to develop an suite of `R` code exercises catered specifically towards biostatistics students new to `R`. The end goal is a [RShiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)/[learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) application with a comprehensive suite of interactive tutorials designed to lead users new to `R` through the essential skills required for many biostat courses at the University of Auckland.

The student should have good `R` programming skills but is not expected to necessarily have come across  [RShiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) or [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/). You will be working closely with me to develop appropriate  materials for the tutorials; a creative streak would be an advantage.
