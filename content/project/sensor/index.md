This project is co-supervised with [Professor David Williams](https://unidirectory.auckland.ac.nz/profile/david-williams) from Chemical Sciences. This project will develop statistical methodology for modelling low resolution sensor networks and assessing the reliability of low cost sensors.

This project will involve data cleaning, manipulation, and visualisation. In addition, the student should expect to be heavily involved in statistical model development. The project is good preparation for those students looking to go into industry. Ideally the student should have good R programming skills and a good grade in STATS 380.
