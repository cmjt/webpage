Remember the first time you learnt R: error messages aplenty and missing brackets in their droves. Now you’ve got a handle on R, it’s your turn to mould the
learning journey for future newbies.

This project will develop an R-based interface that
exposes new users to common R errors and
encourages them to problem solve to find the solution.
This will be specifically targeted to biostatistics
students who often have not been exposed to R or any
other programming language. Upon completion the
interface will eventually be integrated into BIOSCI220.

Strong R programming skills would be an advantage.
