Have a hand in designing memorable worksheets for my future students. Can you one up [ClusterDucks](https://cmjt.github.io/statbiscuits/)? Help your future peers grasp some fundamental statistical concepts.

This project will mainly involve data scraping, cleaning, and visualisation. Documentation of workflow is expected as are reasonable programming skills. Familiarity with `Rmarkdown` would be beneficial. A good grasp of the statistical techniques taught at levels three and above would be advantageous, but not essential. A creative streak would also be an advantage!
