Events cluster in time and space: tweets go viral, flurries of nearby earthquakes occur in quick succession. Temporal and spatial proximity are major factors in the chain reaction of events. However, how and why these spatiotemporal clusters form is much more complex: the mechanisms that generate clusters of events are often self-exciting.

This project will look at what happens when self-excitement is ignored. No familiarity with point processes is needed; however, strong R programming skills are required and familiarity with C++ would be advantageous. Good grades in STATS310 and STATS330 would also be an advantage.
