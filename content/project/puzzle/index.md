[vested](https://statbiscuit.shinyapps.io/vested/) is an Rshiny application that implements a number of different simulated experiments. The application is used in-course to aid in teaching experimental design to biostatistics students. This project would be to convert/rewrite vested (currently written in R) into JavaScript code. Although, much of the technical details are prescribed there is plenty of scope in the design, aesthetics, and layout of the application for creativity!


Strong JavaScript coding skills. R/Rshiny skills desirable. Artistic skills a bonus! Good grades in CS335 and/or CS373 would also be beneficial.
