This project will give you free rein to develop a point and click adventure game with an
educational focus. The game developed will allow players to explore the theories that
underpin statistical methodology, It will allow players to adventure their way through
probability distributions and estimation techniques taught in statistical theory courses.
The student will be expected to be heavily involved in the creative design process. This
project will require the student to have some understanding of the statistical theory involved.

Familiarity with the game engine Unity (or equivalent) would be an advantage; good grades
in CS335 and/or CS373 would also be highly desirable.
