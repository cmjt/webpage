The [River Environment Classification (REC)](https://niwa.co.nz/freshwater-and-estuaries/management-tools/river-environment-classification-0) is a database of catchment spatial attributes, summarised for every segment in New Zealand's network of rivers. Metrics describing hydrology, river bed sediment, fish distributions, invertebrate indices, water quality etc. are available for each river segment.  This project will research methods to best visualise attributes of the connected segments of NZ rivers.

Good `R` programming skills are required as well as a creative side!
